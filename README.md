# glmtree

The goal of glmtree is to build decision trees with logistic regressions at their leaves, so that the resulting model mixes non parametric VS parametric and stepwise VS linear approaches to have the best predictive results, yet maintaining interpretability.

For further instructions, go to the vignette: clic "Get Started" or navigate to vignettes > glmdisc.Rmd or go through the vignette directly in RStudio by typing “vignette(‘glmdtree’)” once the package is installed and loaded.
